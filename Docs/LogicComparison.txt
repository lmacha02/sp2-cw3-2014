## Logic Overview

### Logic1 (Default Logic)
Moves up one floor at a time, taking all customers on the loor with it and letting them step out on their destination floor.
Moves to the top floor and then down.

### Logic2 (Improved Logic)
Moves up one floor at a time but does not stop unless there is a customer waiting to go in the direction of the elevator. 
Changes direction if there is no customer waiting on a floor ahead **and** if there is no customer in the elevator that needs to go in the direction of the elevator.

## Logic Comparison

To compate the 2 implemented elevator logic components, 
we have repeated the same floor and customer amount 5 times.

* 20 Floors
* 25 Customers

| Attempt | Logic1 | Logic2 |
|---------|--------|--------| 
|       1 |     49 |     30 |
|       2 |     37 |     26 |
|       3 |     39 |     29 |
|       4 |     39 |     26 |
|       5 |     39 |     28 |

In each test case, Logic2 has shown that significantly less floors visited.
